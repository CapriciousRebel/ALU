# ALU

### Problem Statement:

Design an IEEE floating-point single-precision (32-bit) ALU that supports the arithmetic and logic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, NOT.


### Goals:
- [x] Initialize the repo

- [x] Initialize the code

- [x] Write the code for ALU

#### Arithmetic:

- [x] 1. Addition

- [ ] 2. Subtaction

- [ ] 3. Multiplication

- [ ] 4. Division

### Logical

- [x] 5. NOT

- [x] 6. AND

- [x] 7. OR

- [x] 8. XOR

### Extra components

- [x] Half Adder

- [x] Full Adder

- [x] Multiplexer(8:1)
